# CHANGELOG

## v0.8.0

- forward-port to Detox v18, this may be a breaking change, stay on jet v7 if you need Detox < v17

## v0.7.0

- remaps backslashes in module names on windows so `jet.require()` works

## v0.6.6-0 (and prior)

no changelogs noted, but they've been in release + usage for 18 months so may considered "stable"
(or at least, "useful")
