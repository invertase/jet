# CHANGELOG

## v0.8.2

- remove jcenter from list of android dependencies
- bump android versions to current react-native template values

## v0.8.1

- forward-port to react-native 0.69 (podspec in root)
- support static framework build (required for firebase-ios-sdk v9)
- various package.json / podspec fixups

## v0.8.0

- forward-port to Detox v18, this may be a breaking change, stay on jet v7 if you need Detox < v17

## v0.7.0

- remaps backslashes in module names on windows so `jet.require()` works

## v0.6.6-0 (and prior)

no changelogs noted, but they've been in release + usage for 18 months so may considered "stable"
(or at least, "useful")
